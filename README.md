# Module-10-Assignment
## Unsupervised Learnings on Cryptocurrency Portfolio data

Here I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, I want to include other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for your portfolio.

- Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
- Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
- Visualize and Compare the Results

## Usage

To use this application, simply clone the repository and open jupyter lab from git bash by running the following command:

```python
jupyter lab
```

Upon launching the application in Jupyter lab notebook, run the file by using the run button on the top of the notepad.
